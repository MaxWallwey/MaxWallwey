          Iâ€™m a motivated and detail-oriented Software Engineer based in the UK,
          with a strong international perspective shaped by growing up in
          Germany. I specialize in full-stack development, object-oriented
          programming, and agile methodologies, with a passion for creating
          scalable, user-centric solutions. Continuously driven by curiosity, I
          actively seek out opportunities to learn and work with emerging
          technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments where innovative
          tools and approaches are used to build products that make a real
          impact.
