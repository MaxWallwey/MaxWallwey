## About me
Iâ€™m a motivated and detail-oriented Software Engineer based in the UK, with a strong international perspective shaped by growing up in Germany. I specialize in full-stack development, object-oriented programming, and agile methodologies, with a passion for creating scalable, user-centric solutions. Continuously driven by curiosity, I actively seek out opportunities to learn and work with emerging technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments where innovative tools and approaches are used to build products that make a real impact.
